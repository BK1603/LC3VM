# LC3VM

A little computer 3 virtual machine. This is a hobby project and the first time
I've implemented a VM. Thanks to the tutorial at https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/

# Steps to run:

- Compile the source files.
```
gcc -o lc3 src/*.c
```
- Run the included image files.
```
lc3 img/rogue.obj
